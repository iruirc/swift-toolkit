# Orchestrator

Single entry point for routing tasks from `Tasks/<STATUS>/<task_id>-*/` into the corresponding profile workflow. The skill accepts a minimal input (only `task_id`), fills in the remaining parameters via a deterministic algorithm, and hands control to `swift-toolkit:workflow-*` via a structured contract.

The skill itself does not perform the work of stages — it only resolves parameters, validates the command, confirms with the user (in `manual` mode), and dispatches control to the profile workflow.

## Language Resolution

Before producing any user-facing string:

1. Read `CLAUDE.md` from the project root.
2. Find the `## Language` section.
3. Take the first non-empty line in that section, lowercase and trim it. That is `<lang>`.
4. If `<lang>` is `en` or `ru`, use it. Otherwise default to `en`.
5. Read this skill's `locales/<lang>.md`. Look up keys by H2 header.
6. If a key is missing, fall back to the same key in `locales/en.md`. If still missing, that's a bug — fail loudly with key name.

Caching: resolve `<lang>` once per skill invocation; do not re-read CLAUDE.md per string.

## Tool Loading (preamble)

`AskUserQuestion` in the current Claude Code is loaded lazily. The **first action** the orchestrator performs on any run:

```
ToolSearch select:AskUserQuestion
```

Once the schema is loaded, `AskUserQuestion` may be called. If loading fails for any reason (older environment, tool missing), use a textual fallback: ask the question with numbered options in a regular message and parse the user's reply. Use the `fallback_profile_question` locale key for the prompt text.

Reply parsing: a digit, the profile name, or an unambiguous prefix (`bug`, `ref`, `test`).

## Resilient Input Contract

The minimum viable input is just `task_id`. All other fields are optional and resolved in the Resolution Algorithm.

| Field | Type | Source | Default / Error |
|---|---|---|---|
| `task_id` | string | NL/$ARGUMENTS (e.g. `026`, `137`, `001-foo`) | **required** — error using key `error_no_task_id` |
| `action` | enum: `run` / `continue` / `redo` / `restart` / `restart-full` | parsed from the command (see triggers table) | `run` for a bare "run/do/execute N", `continue` for "continue N" |
| `stage_target` | string (profile stage name) | required for `redo` / `restart`, or for `--from` / `--to` modifiers under `run` | not needed for `run` / `continue` / `restart-full` without modifiers |
| `mode_override` | enum: `manual` / `auto` | explicit "automatically" / "step-by-step" in the request | resolved from Task.md → CLAUDE.md → `manual` |
| `stack_override` | string | stack explicitly named in the request | resolved from Task.md → CLAUDE.md → imports → AskUserQuestion |

**Invariant:** the orchestrator does NOT crash on missing optional fields. It resolves them in the Resolution Algorithm and only then hands the fully populated contract to workflow-*.

## Routing

The orchestrator does not activate on every user request — light commands bypass it. Order of checks (first match wins):

1. **Project initialization** — "create project" / "initialize" / no `.xcodeproj` and no `Package.swift` → remind about agent `swift-toolkit:swift-init` (invocation: `@swift-toolkit:swift-init` or slash command `/swift-init`). Orchestrator does not run.
2. **Task management** — "create task" / "new task" / "ft" / "create sub-task for N" → skill `task-new`. "Move task" / "to DONE" / "step N of epic M to <STATUS>" → skill `task-move`. Orchestrator does not run.
3. **Micro-edit** — "fix" / "rename" / "change" + ≤2 files with no interface changes → execute directly with a quick check via XcodeBuildMCP. Orchestrator does not run.
4. **Otherwise** — this is task work. The orchestrator runs:
   - Is there a `Task.md` for `task_id`? Yes → read `[TASK_TYPE]`, `[WORKFLOW_MODE]` (if present), `## 4. [Stack]` (if present), `[STATUS]` (for steps).
   - No → run `task-new`, then continue.
   - Determine the profile from `[TASK_TYPE]` (see Dispatch).
   - Confirmation/skip is governed in Resolution Algorithm, step 6 (single source of truth).

## State Detection

The source of truth is `Plan.md` (the progress table with checkboxes `⬜ 🔄 ✅ ⏸ 🚫 ⊘`).

Checkbox legend: `⬜` = todo (planned), `🔄` = in progress, `✅` = done, `⏸` = paused, `🚫` = blocked, `⊘` = skipped.

Algorithm:

1. Task folder is in `Tasks/DONE/` OR `Done.md` exists → the task is considered finished. `AskUserQuestion`: confirm a full restart (=`action=restart-full`), reopen (move back into `ACTIVE/`), or exit.
2. `Plan.md` exists → parse the progress table and phase checkboxes; resume from the first unfinished stage (the first `⬜` or `🔄`).
   - If the progress table is missing or corrupt (Plan.md exists but does not parse) — the orchestrator considers stage `Plan` complete but cannot determine the resume point: it starts at the profile's `Execute` stage (if any) with a warning to the user; otherwise it asks explicitly via `AskUserQuestion`.
3. No `Plan.md`, but `Research.md` exists → start at the profile's `Plan` stage.
4. Nothing exists → start at the profile's first stage. The exact name of the first stage is determined by the corresponding `swift-toolkit:workflow-<profile>` skill; the orchestrator does not duplicate that list.

**De-sync:**
- `Task.md` is newer than `Plan.md` → warn that the task description may have changed after planning; suggest `redo Plan`.
- Git contains commits touching task files without checkbox updates in `Plan.md` → warn about the desync; do not block, but flag it in the outbound contract.

## Resolution Algorithm

```
1. Validate & find task folder:
   • If task_id is not provided → error using key `error_no_task_id` and stop.
   • Otherwise — locate the folder Tasks/<STATUS>/<task_id>-*/ (scan Tasks/**/<task_id>-* across all STATUS folders).
   • For steps: Tasks/**/<parent_id>-*/.../<step_id>.step/
   ↓ if not found → error using key `error_task_not_found` with placeholder `{task_id}`

2. Resolve TASK_TYPE → profile
   • Read Task.md, extract the [TASK_TYPE] field
   ↓ if missing → AskUserQuestion using key `fallback_profile_question`
   ↓ profile = workflow-<TASK_TYPE.lower()>

3. Resolve mode (priority high→low):
   mode_override (NL: "automatically" / "step-by-step")
   > Task.md [WORKFLOW_MODE]
   > CLAUDE.md "## Mode"
   > "manual" (default)

4. Resolve stack (priority high→low):
   stack_override (explicit in the request)
   > Task.md "## 4. [Stack]"
   > CLAUDE.md "## Modules" (if the task's files fall into one of the listed modules)
   > CLAUDE.md "## Stack"
   > auto-detection by imports of the affected files
   > AskUserQuestion (last fallback)

5. Resolve start_stage (depends on action):
   action=run, stage_target=null  → state-detection: first unfinished stage
   action=run, stage_target=X     → start at X (--from), do not touch previous stages
   action=continue                → state-detection (same as run without stage)
   action=redo, stage_target=X    → start at X, re-execute ONLY this stage
   action=restart, stage_target=X → start at X, re-execute X and all subsequent stages
   action=restart-full            → start at the profile's first stage, re-execute all

6. Confirmation in manual mode:
   if mode == manual:
       AskUserQuestion using key `confirm_dispatch` with placeholders `{profile}`, `{mode}`, `{stack}`, `{start_stage}`
   else:
       skip confirmation, go straight to Dispatch

   Confirmation is also skipped if both key parameters (profile AND mode) are explicitly stated in the user's original command.
   "Explicitly stated" = present as literal keywords in the request text.
   Example: `run 026 as BUG automatically` — confirmation skipped (both "BUG" and "automatically" are present).
   Example: `run 026` — confirmation required (neither profile nor mode is explicit).
```

See also the "Stage Management" section — it details the semantics of `run --from` / `redo` / `restart` / `restart-full` and the "what gets archived" matrix.

## Outbound Contract

After Resolution, the orchestrator calls `Skill` with args in `key=value` form, **separated only by newlines** (a comma is NOT used as a field separator). **All fields are filled** — workflow-* never tries to recover anything.

Multi-valued fields (e.g. `archive_paths`) are encoded in **list syntax**: square brackets, commas inside.

```
task_id=001
profile=feature
action=run|continue|redo|restart|restart-full
start_stage=Plan
start_phase=2.3
end_stage=null
stage_scope=single|forward|all
mode=manual|auto
stack=swiftui+combine+swinject
need_test=true|false
need_review=true|false
archive_paths=[Tasks/ACTIVE/001-profile/_archive/Plan-2026-04-25T143022.md, Tasks/ACTIVE/001-profile/_archive/Research-2026-04-25T143022.md]
```

Semantics of `stage_scope`:
- `single` — only `start_stage` (for `redo`)
- `forward` — `start_stage` → end (for `run --from`, `continue`, `restart <stage>`)
- `all` — every stage of the profile, from first to last (for `restart-full`)

`end_stage` — filled only when `--to <stage>` is used (e.g. "do 026 up to plan"); otherwise `null`.

`start_phase` — for phase-level resume inside a stage (e.g. `Execute:phase=2.3`). Filled only when the trigger names a phase ("start from phase 2.3", "redo phase 2.3"); otherwise `null`.

`archive_paths` — list of paths to backups already created in `_archive/` for stages that will be overwritten (filled before handing off control). Format: `[path1, path2, path3]`. Empty list = `[]`.

**Invariant:** workflow-* never receives empty fields. If a field arrives empty — workflow-* returns an error to the orchestrator and does not try to recover.

## Dispatch

| TASK_TYPE | Workflow skill |
|---|---|
| FEATURE | `swift-toolkit:workflow-feature` |
| BUG | `swift-toolkit:workflow-bug` |
| REFACTOR | `swift-toolkit:workflow-refactor` |
| TEST | `swift-toolkit:workflow-test` |
| REVIEW | `swift-toolkit:workflow-review` |
| EPIC | `swift-toolkit:workflow-epic` |

Action after Resolution: invoke the `Skill` tool with `name` from the table and `args` in Outbound Contract format.

## Gating

**Manual** (default) — pause after each stage with an `AskUserQuestion` (use key `stage_done_prompt` with placeholder `{stage}`) confirming the move to the next; discussions that don't fit in a single reply are recorded in the task's `Questions.md`.

**Auto** — no pauses between stages. **The commit is always confirmed with the user** regardless of mode.

**Backup before overwriting / removing an artifact:** copy to `Tasks/<STATUS>/<task_id>-*/_archive/<stage>-<timestamp>.md`, where `<timestamp>` is ISO-8601 without colons (`2026-04-25T143022`). The orchestrator makes the backup BEFORE calling workflow-* and passes the paths via `archive_paths` in the outbound contract.

In `manual` mode, an `AskUserQuestion` confirmation is mandatory before the backup / removal.

## Stage Management

Triggers (free-form, parsed into `action` + `stage_target`):

| User text | action | stage_target | stage_scope |
|---|---|---|---|
| "run 026" / "do 026" / "execute 026" | `run` | null | `forward` (from the state-detection point) |
| "continue 026" | `continue` | null | `forward` |
| "do 026 up to plan" | `run` | null (`end_stage=Plan`) | `forward` (capped at the top) |
| "only plan for 026" / "only research for 026" | `run` | `<stage>` (`end_stage=<stage>`) | `single` |
| "start from Plan for 026" | `run` | `Plan` (as `--from`) | `forward` |
| "redo plan for 026" | `redo` | `Plan` | `single` |
| "start from phase 2.3 for 026" | `run` | `<stage>:phase=2.3` | `forward` (from the phase anchor) |
| "redo phase 2.3 for 026" | `redo` | `<stage>:phase=2.3` | `single` (at the phase level) |
| "rerun validation for 026" | `redo` | `Validation` | `single` |
| "start over for 026" | `restart-full` | null | `all` |

> Note on the semantics of "rerun": `rerun <stage>` = `redo` of a single stage (an atomic redo). Do not confuse it with `restart`, which resets `<stage>` AND every subsequent stage. The user verb "rerun" here is closer in meaning to "redo atomically" than to "reset and walk through to the end again".

Action and archival semantics:

| Action | Semantics | What gets archived in `_archive/` | Where it starts |
|---|---|---|---|
| `run --from <stage>` | Skip previous stages | nothing | from `<stage>` |
| `redo <stage>` | Redo one stage | `<stage>` artifact | from `<stage>`, after = untouched |
| `restart <stage>` | Reset and rerun from stage to end | `<stage>` and all subsequent | from `<stage>` to end of profile |
| `restart-full` | Full reset | all artifacts | from the profile's first stage |

**All redo / restart operations in manual mode require an `AskUserQuestion` BEFORE archiving.**

Command validation:
- "only Plan" / "start from Plan" without `Research.md` (for profiles that have a preceding `Research`) → error using key `error_research_required` with placeholder `{stage}`.
- "redo <stage>" with no `<stage>` artifact present → error using key `error_redo_no_artifact` with placeholder `{stage}`; suggest `run --from <stage>`.
- A stage name not from the current profile → error listing the allowed stages.

## Subagent Context

The workflow-* subagent receives:

1. The full text of the task's `Task.md` (as is).
2. A short summary of previous stages (1–3 paragraphs): what was done, key decisions, open questions. Pulled from the most recent artifacts (`Research.md`, `Plan.md`).
3. Stack: the `stack` value from the Outbound Contract.
4. Mode: `mode` from the Outbound Contract.

**The stack does not need to be re-sent in full text:** the skill does not `Read` the project-level `CLAUDE.md` — stack, mode, and paths come from the context Claude Code typically loads at session start (when `CLAUDE.md` is present at the project root). The orchestrator parses this already-loaded context to resolve priorities.
