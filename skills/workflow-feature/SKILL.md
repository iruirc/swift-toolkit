# Workflow Feature

The profile workflow for tasks with `[TASK_TYPE] = FEATURE`. Implements the sequence of stages; the result of each stage is an artifact file inside the task folder. The skill receives an already-resolved contract from the orchestrator and does not try to re-resolve any parameter on its own.

## Language Resolution

Before producing any user-facing string:

1. Read `CLAUDE.md` from the project root.
2. Find the `## Language` section.
3. Take the first non-empty line in that section, lowercase and trim it. That is `<lang>`.
4. If `<lang>` is `en` or `ru`, use it. Otherwise default to `en`.
5. Read this skill's `locales/<lang>.md`. Look up keys by H2 header.
6. If a key is missing, fall back to the same key in `locales/en.md`. If still missing, that's a bug — fail loudly with key name.

Caching: resolve `<lang>` once per skill invocation; do not re-read CLAUDE.md per string.

## 1. Input Contract

The skill is invoked by `swift-toolkit:orchestrator` via the `Skill` tool with structured `args` in `key=value` form, separated only by newlines.

The field structure is documented in `swift-toolkit:orchestrator` (section **Outbound Contract**). Workflow-feature accepts every field already filled — invariant.

If a required field arrives empty — workflow-feature does not try to recover. It returns `{status: error, reason: status_error_empty_required_field}` (the `reason` value is taken from the locale key in `locales/<lang>.md`) back to the orchestrator.

The fields that directly drive this workflow's behavior:
- `start_stage`, `end_stage`, `stage_scope` — determine which stages run.
- `start_phase` — entry point inside a stage (e.g. `Execute:phase=2.3`).
- `mode` — `manual` / `auto` (see sections 3 and 4).
- `stack` — passed to subagents as context.
- `need_test`, `need_review` — gate the inclusion of `swift-toolkit:swift-tester` and `swift-toolkit:swift-reviewer`.
- `archive_paths` — paths to backups already created (the orchestrator made them BEFORE the call; workflow-feature does not create them).

**Execution range.** Stages run in the order Research → Plan → Execute → Validation → Review → Done, starting at `start_stage` and continuing through `end_stage` inclusive. If `end_stage=null` — through the end of the profile. If `end_stage` is set but precedes `start_stage` in order, that is a contract error: return `{status: error, reason: "end_stage before start_stage"}`.

**Scope.** `stage_scope` controls execution width:
- `single` — only `start_stage` runs; afterwards the workflow returns `{status: ok, last_completed_stage: <start_stage>, next_recommended_action: stop}`. Used for `action=redo`.
- `forward` — `start_stage` plus every subsequent stage up to `end_stage` (or to the end of the profile). Used for `action=run`/`continue`/`restart`.
- `all` — equivalent to `forward` with `start_stage = first stage of the profile`. Used for `action=restart-full`.

## 2. Stages

- **Research** — a panel: `swift-toolkit:swift-architect` + `swift-toolkit:swift-security` (via the Task tool, in parallel or sequentially as the orchestrator decides). Artifact: `Research.md` in the task folder. Goal: investigate the domain, surface risks, propose architectural options.

- **Plan** — `swift-toolkit:swift-architect`. Artifact: `Plan.md` with a phase progress table (see `State Detection` in orchestrator: statuses ✅/🔄/⬜/⏸/🚫/⊘). The plan decomposes the feature into concrete phases and steps.

- **Execute** — `swift-toolkit:swift-developer` + `swift-toolkit:swift-tester` (if `need_test=true` in args). Implements the phases from `Plan.md` step by step, updating the progress table after each phase. Artifacts: source code in the project + tests.

  If `start_phase=<phase_id>` was passed in args — `swift-toolkit:swift-developer` receives that phase as the start point in the Task-tool prompt. Already-completed phases (status `✅` in `Plan.md`) are skipped, not redone. The progress table is updated only for new / changed phases.

- **Validation** — XcodeBuildMCP (`build_sim`, `test_sim`) + optionally mobile MCP (E2E key-path scenario; mandatory when there is a UI layer — SwiftUI/UIKit views, screens, navigation; skipped for purely domain/infrastructure features). Verifies the feature builds and passes tests. Artifact: `Validation.md` with the log and the verdict.

- **Review** — `swift-toolkit:swift-reviewer` (if `need_review=true` in args). Artifact: `Review.md`, **first line is required** to be `[REVIEW_STATUS] = APPROVED | CHANGES_REQUESTED | DISCUSSION` (this field is the shared contract between workflow-* and the orchestrator; it is also used by `swift-toolkit:workflow-review` for auto-move into DONE/).

- **Done** — final report `Done.md`: what was done, which artifacts were produced, validation status (build/test result), and objections (if the user insisted on a contested decision).

## 3. Manual mode

After each completed stage the orchestrator asks the user via `AskUserQuestion` using the `stage_done_prompt` key from `locales/<lang>.md`, with placeholder `{stage}`.

Workflow-feature **does NOT call `AskUserQuestion` itself** — it returns control to the orchestrator after a stage completes (see section 5, Output Contract) with `next_recommended_action`. The decision to pause, continue, or capture discussions in `Questions.md` is the orchestrator's responsibility.

If the host CLI does not support `AskUserQuestion`, the orchestrator uses a textual fallback (numbered options + reply parsing). That is the orchestrator's responsibility, not workflow-feature's.

## 4. Auto mode

No pauses between stages. Workflow-feature runs the stages sequentially within `stage_scope` and returns the final result to the orchestrator in a single output.

The only step that always requires confirmation regardless of mode is the final commit, when the orchestrator initiates the commit flow. That is again the orchestrator's responsibility, not workflow-feature's.

## 5. Output Contract

After each stage (in `manual` mode) or after a full pass (in `auto` mode), workflow-feature returns a JSON-like structure to the orchestrator:

```
{
  status: ok | error | cancelled | interrupted,
  last_completed_stage: Research | Plan | Execute | Validation | Review | Done,
  artifact_path: <path to the final artifact, e.g. Tasks/ACTIVE/001-feature/Done.md>,
  next_recommended_action: continue | stop | ask_user,
  notes: <free-form text, optional>
}
```

Field semantics:
- `status=ok` — the stage finished correctly.
- `status=error` — an error occurred (including reasons such as the locale key `status_error_empty_required_field`, an invalid contract, or a fatal subagent failure).
- `status=cancelled` — the user explicitly declined to continue (the orchestrator forwarded a `No` from its AUQ; rendered to the user via locale key `status_cancelled_user_no`). A normal outcome, not an error.
- `status=interrupted` — execution was interrupted by a technical fault or external signal (not by user decision): subagent disconnect, timeout, tool unavailable. Requires diagnostics on the orchestrator side.
- `last_completed_stage` — the last stage that actually finished (not the one execution stopped on with an error).
- `artifact_path` — path to the key artifact of the last stage (`Research.md`, `Plan.md`, `Validation.md`, `Review.md`, `Done.md`).
- `next_recommended_action=continue` — the next stage may start immediately; `stop` — natural finish (Done) or a fatal error; `ask_user` — confirmation is needed before continuing (e.g. after a Review with `CHANGES_REQUESTED`).
- `notes` — short free-form description (e.g. the example in locale key `notes_build_failed_example`).

Based on this, the orchestrator decides: continue, abort, or ask the user.

## 6. What workflow-feature does NOT do

- Does NOT route — profile selection happens in the orchestrator before the call.
- Does NOT read `Task.md` to determine stack/mode — everything arrives in `args`.
- Does NOT trigger `task-new` or `task-move` — that is not its scope.
- Does NOT decide to skip stages — the orchestrator already passed `start_stage`, `end_stage`, `stage_scope`.
- Does NOT create backups in `_archive/` — the orchestrator did so before handing off control; the paths are already in `archive_paths`.
- Does NOT call `AskUserQuestion` — the orchestrator does that between stages in `manual` mode.
- Does NOT confirm the commit with the user — the orchestrator handles that after a `next_recommended_action` return.
