# Workflow Epic

The profile workflow for tasks with `[TASK_TYPE] = EPIC`. Unlike the other workflow-* skills, EPIC has a branch on the Plan stage: **decomposition** (split into `.step/` subfolders and run them sequentially) or **pure_research** (Research.md is the final artifact; no implementation follows). The skill receives an already-resolved contract from the orchestrator and does not try to re-resolve any parameter on its own.

## Language Resolution

Before producing any user-facing string:

1. Read `CLAUDE.md` from the project root.
2. Find the `## Language` section.
3. Take the first non-empty line in that section, lowercase and trim it. That is `<lang>`.
4. If `<lang>` is `en` or `ru`, use it. Otherwise default to `en`.
5. Read this skill's `locales/<lang>.md`. Look up keys by H2 header.
6. If a key is missing, fall back to the same key in `locales/en.md`. If still missing, that's a bug — fail loudly with key name.

Caching: resolve `<lang>` once per skill invocation; do not re-read CLAUDE.md per string.

## 1. Input Contract

The skill is invoked by `swift-toolkit:orchestrator` via the `Skill` tool with structured `args` in `key=value` form, separated only by newlines.

The field structure is documented in `swift-toolkit:orchestrator` (section **Outbound Contract**). Workflow-epic accepts every field already filled — invariant.

If a required field arrives empty — workflow-epic does not try to recover. It returns `{status: error, reason: status_error_empty_required_field}` (the `reason` value is taken from the locale key in `locales/<lang>.md`) back to the orchestrator.

Key fields and their EPIC-specific semantics:
- `start_stage`, `end_stage`, `stage_scope` — determine which stages run.
- `start_phase` — for EPIC means the **`step_id`** (e.g. `start_phase=2.step` or `start_phase=composition-model.step`), not a phase inside a stage. Research/Plan stages are not decomposed into the usual phases — the resume unit inside Execute is a step.
- `stage_scope=single` — for EPIC means **"a single step"**, not a single stage. Used for `redo` or pinpoint re-runs of one step.
- `mode` — `manual` / `auto` (see sections 3 and 4). The epic's mode is inherited by each step at delegation time, unless the step has its own `[WORKFLOW_MODE]` in its `Task.md`.
- `stack` — passed to Research/Plan subagents, and inherited by the steps (unless they have their own `## 4. [Stack]`).
- `need_test`, `need_review` — at the epic level only gate Plan/Research; at the step level the decision is made by each step's own workflow-* based on its own Task.md.
- `archive_paths` — paths to backups already created (the orchestrator made them BEFORE the call; workflow-epic does not create them).
- `epic_dispatch_mode` — **an additional optional field, EPIC-specific**: `push` (default) or `pull`. Set by the orchestrator based on a pre-flight check of nested `Skill` invocation (see section 2.3, Execute).

**Execution range.** Stages run in the order Research → Plan → Execute → Done, starting at `start_stage` and continuing through `end_stage` inclusive. If the Plan stage chose the **pure_research** branch — Execute is skipped, the workflow goes straight to Done with `last_completed_stage=Plan` and `branch=pure_research`. If `end_stage=null` — through the end of the profile. If `end_stage` is set but precedes `start_stage` in order, that is a contract error: return `{status: error, reason: "end_stage before start_stage"}`.

**Scope.** `stage_scope` controls execution width:
- `single` — only `start_stage` runs. For Execute that means "a single step" (the one named in `start_phase=<step_id>`).
- `forward` — `start_stage` plus every subsequent stage up to `end_stage` (or to the end of the profile).
- `all` — equivalent to `forward` with `start_stage = Research`. Used for `action=restart-full`.

## 2. Stages

- **Research** — `swift-toolkit:swift-architect`. Artifact: `Research.md` in the epic's folder. Goal: a wide investigation of the topic (context, actors, constraints, technology options, related modules). The Research output must answer: **is decomposition required** (a large initiative needs to be split into executable chunks) **or is pure research enough** (Research.md is itself the final artifact; no implementation will follow).

- **Plan** — `swift-toolkit:swift-architect`. **Two branches:**

  **Branch A — Decomposition.**
  - Artifact: `Plan.md` with a progress table of **`.step/` subfolders** (not phases inside a single profile).
  - Each step is described as a separate task: it has its own `[TASK_TYPE]` (FEATURE/BUG/REFACTOR/TEST/EPIC — yes, recursive EPIC is allowed), its own `[STATUS]` ∈ {TODO, ACTIVE, DONE, DEFERRED, BLOCKED, SKIPPED}, an optional `[WORKFLOW_MODE]`, and its own `## 4. [Stack]` (or inherits from the epic).
  - Step folders are created physically: `Tasks/<STATUS>/<epic-id>-<slug>/1.step/`, `2.step/`, …, `composition-model.step/` (any name with the `.step` suffix). Each contains its own `Task.md`. Creating the physical folders is the responsibility of `swift-toolkit:task-new` (see section 6).
  - The progress table in Plan.md lists steps in execution order with columns: `step_id | TASK_TYPE | [STATUS] | short description | artifact`.

  **Branch B — Pure research.**
  - Artifact: `Research.md` is extended/finalized. `Plan.md` is optional, written as a "research roadmap" (what else needs investigation, no decomposition into executable steps).
  - The workflow proceeds straight to Done (the Execute stage is skipped; in the output contract `branch=pure_research`, `last_completed_stage=Plan`, `completed_steps=[]`).

  The branch decision is made based on `Research.md` and recorded inside it under the literal English H2 heading `## Decomposition decision`. (This heading is a stable structural anchor that workflow-epic later reads to know which branch to take; it MUST stay English regardless of project language. The free-form prose under the heading is composed by the architect agent in the user's natural language.) Workflow-epic reads this section and acts accordingly — **it does not pick the branch on its own** (see section 6).

- **Execute** (only on branch A — Decomposition). Walks the `.step/` subfolders sequentially — by prefix order (`1.step` → `2.step` → … for numeric prefixes; for named ones — in the order locked in `Plan.md`). **Steps are NOT run in parallel** — strictly sequential, for predictability and clean state recovery.

  For each step:
  - Read `<step>/Task.md`, extract `[STATUS]` and `[TASK_TYPE]`.
  - If `[STATUS]` ∈ {DEFERRED, BLOCKED, SKIPPED, DONE} — skip; record the skip in the output contract's `skipped_steps` with the reason and move on.
  - Otherwise — delegate the step (see push vs pull below).
  - If the step returned `status=error` — stop the walk, record in `failed_steps`, return control to the orchestrator with status `partial` (if at least one step had already finished) or `error` (if the very first executable step failed).
  - If the step returned `status=cancelled` (user declined in its AUQ) — stop the walk, status `partial` or `cancelled`.

  **Push vs Pull dispatch models.**

  - **Push (the recommended default):** workflow-epic invokes the `Skill` tool with `name=swift-toolkit:orchestrator` and args describing the step (effectively as a new task: `task_id=<step_id>`, the epic context inherited via args). It awaits the inner orchestrator's result, records the outcome, then moves to the next step. Used when the orchestrator's pre-flight confirmed that nested `Skill` invocation works.

  - **Pull (fallback):** workflow-epic **does NOT call** the orchestrator. Instead: it walks every `.step/` folder, builds an ordered list of `[{step_id, task_id, profile, mode, …}]`, and returns it to the orchestrator via the `Output Contract` in the `pending_steps` field. The orchestrator then sequentially dispatches each step itself as ordinary tasks. Used when push does not work or the orchestrator explicitly requested pull.

  **Mode selection:**
  - If `epic_dispatch_mode=push` was passed in args — use push.
  - If `epic_dispatch_mode=pull` — use pull (skip actually running the steps; populate `pending_steps`).
  - If the field is absent — default to `push`.

  The documented happy path is push. Pull exists only as a fallback for environments where nested `Skill` invocation does not work.

- **Done** — final report `Done.md` for the epic:
  - Which steps finished (with links to their `Done.md`).
  - Which were skipped and why (DEFERRED/BLOCKED/SKIPPED/DONE_already).
  - Which BLOCKED steps require user action (an explicit list with the blocker description).
  - Overall epic progress (X out of Y steps complete).
  - Objections (aggregated from each step's `Done.md` if the user insisted on a contested decision in any of them).
  - For branch B (pure_research) — Done.md is short, points at `Research.md` as the final artifact; the steps section is empty.

## 3. Manual mode

After each stage (Research, Plan) and **after each step in Execute**, the orchestrator asks the user via `AskUserQuestion` using the `stage_done_prompt` key from `locales/<lang>.md`, with placeholders `{stage}` and `{step_id}`.

Workflow-epic **does NOT call `AskUserQuestion` itself** — it returns control to the orchestrator after a stage or a step completes with `next_recommended_action`. The decision to pause, continue, or capture discussions in the epic's `Questions.md` is the orchestrator's responsibility.

In push mode, pauses between the inner stages of a step are the responsibility of the nested orchestrator call (it dispatches the step as an ordinary task). Workflow-epic only pauses between **steps themselves**, not inside them.

## 4. Auto mode

No pauses. Steps in Execute run sequentially one after another; the only interruption is when a step returns `status=error` or `status=cancelled`. The final commit, when the orchestrator initiates the commit flow after Done, is always confirmed with the user (that is the orchestrator's responsibility, not workflow-epic's).

## 5. Output Contract (extended)

The EPIC output contract is extended with fields for steps and the branch. After each stage (in `manual` mode) or after a full pass (in `auto` mode), workflow-epic returns a JSON-like structure to the orchestrator:

```
{
  status: ok | error | cancelled | interrupted | partial,
  last_completed_stage: Research | Plan | Execute | Done,
  branch: decomposition | pure_research,
  artifact_path: <path to Done.md or Research.md>,
  next_recommended_action: continue | stop | ask_user,
  notes: <free-form text, optional>,

  # For the decomposition branch — extended fields:
  completed_steps: [{step_id, task_id, status: ok|error|cancelled|interrupted}],
  skipped_steps:   [{step_id, task_id, reason: DEFERRED|BLOCKED|SKIPPED|DONE_already}],
  failed_steps:    [{step_id, task_id, error_reason}],

  # For the pull model:
  pending_steps:   [{step_id, task_id, profile, mode, stack, ...}]
}
```

Field semantics:
- `status=ok` — every executable step (or the single stage) finished successfully.
- `status=error` — a fatal error (e.g. the first step crashed or the contract was violated).
- `status=cancelled` — the user explicitly declined to continue (rendered to the user via locale key `status_cancelled_user_no`). A normal outcome.
- `status=interrupted` — execution was interrupted by a technical fault (timeout, subagent loss).
- `status=partial` — **EPIC-specific**: some steps finished successfully and some failed/blocked/cancelled. The orchestrator decides what to show the user and whether to continue.
- `branch=decomposition` — the Plan stage chose decomposition; there are steps.
- `branch=pure_research` — the Plan stage chose pure research; `completed_steps`/`skipped_steps`/`failed_steps`/`pending_steps` are empty.
- `last_completed_stage` — the last stage that actually finished (for pure_research the maximum is `Plan`).
- `artifact_path` — path to the key artifact: `Done.md` for decomposition; `Research.md` (or `Plan.md` if a research roadmap exists) for pure_research.
- `next_recommended_action=continue` — the next stage or step may start immediately; `stop` — finish or fatal error; `ask_user` — confirmation is needed (e.g. after `partial` or after a step whose Review returned `CHANGES_REQUESTED`).
- `pending_steps` — populated only in the pull model; an ordered list of steps the orchestrator must sequentially dispatch itself. In push mode this is always `[]`.

Based on this, the orchestrator decides: continue, abort, ask the user, or dispatch the pending_steps.

## 6. What workflow-epic does NOT do

- Does NOT route — profile selection happens in the orchestrator before the call.
- Does NOT read the epic's `Task.md` to determine stack/mode — everything arrives in `args`.
- Does NOT create `.step/` subfolders itself — that is the responsibility of `swift-toolkit:task-new` (invoked by the orchestrator or the user before EPIC starts, or by the Plan stage instructing the architect to create step folders via task-new).
- Does NOT modify step `[STATUS]` values — that is the job of `swift-toolkit:task-move` (invoked by the subagent inside each step at completion).
- Does NOT decide between pure_research vs decomposition — that decision is recorded inside `Research.md` under the `## Decomposition decision` heading during the Research stage; workflow-epic just reads it and acts.
- Does NOT dispatch steps in parallel — only sequentially (for predictability and clean resume).
- Does NOT create backups in `_archive/` — the orchestrator did so before handing off control; the paths are already in `archive_paths`.
- Does NOT call `AskUserQuestion` — the orchestrator does that between stages and between steps in `manual` mode.
- Does NOT confirm the commit with the user — the orchestrator handles that after a `next_recommended_action` return.
