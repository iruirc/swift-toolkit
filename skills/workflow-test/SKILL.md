# Workflow Test

This skill is **Method B** for the TEST profile: it runs the stages when the host has no Workflow tool. `workflows/profile-test.js` is Method A and runs the same stages as code. The orchestrator picks between them (see `swift-toolkit:orchestrator` → **Dispatch**), and `scripts/lint-workflows.sh` fails if the two stage lists drift apart. Edit a stage here and the script needs the same edit.

The profile workflow for tasks with `[TASK_TYPE] = TEST` — used when writing tests is the primary goal of the task (not part of FEATURE/BUG, where tests ship alongside the implementation). Implements the sequence of stages; the result of each stage is an artifact file inside the task folder. The skill receives an already-resolved contract from the orchestrator and does not try to re-resolve any parameter on its own.

## Language Resolution

Before producing any user-facing string:

1. Read `CLAUDE-swift-toolkit.md` from the project root.
2. Find the `## Language` section.
3. Take the first non-empty line in that section, lowercase and trim it. That is `<lang>`.
4. If `<lang>` is `en` or `ru`, use it. Otherwise default to `en`.
5. Read this skill's `locales/<lang>.md`. Look up keys by H2 header.
6. If a key is missing, fall back to the same key in `locales/en.md`. If still missing, that's a bug — fail loudly with key name.

Caching: resolve `<lang>` once per skill invocation; do not re-read CLAUDE-swift-toolkit.md per string.

## 1. Input Contract

The skill is invoked by `swift-toolkit:orchestrator` via the `Skill` tool with structured `args` in `key=value` form, separated only by newlines.

The field structure is documented in `swift-toolkit:orchestrator` (section **Outbound Contract**). Workflow-test accepts every field already filled — invariant.

If a required field arrives empty — workflow-test does not try to recover. It returns `{status: error, reason: status_error_empty_required_field}` (the `reason` value is taken from the locale key in `locales/<lang>.md`) back to the orchestrator.

The fields that directly drive this workflow's behavior:
- `start_stage`, `end_stage`, `stage_scope` — determine which stages run.
- `start_phase` — entry point inside a stage (e.g. `Write:phase=2.3`).
- `task_dir` — the resolved task folder; every artifact this profile writes lands there.
- `mode` — `manual` / `auto` (see sections 3 and 4).
- `stack` — passed to subagents as context (including the chosen test framework, if already determined).
- `lang` — project language for artifact prose + the final report; artifact structure (headings, field labels, status enums) stays EN. See `conventions/i18n.md` → "Artifact authoring rule". Passed through to every subagent.
- `need_review` — gates the inclusion of `swift-toolkit:swift-reviewer` (the `need_test` flag is meaningless for the TEST profile: tests ARE the primary artifact).
- `archive_paths` — paths to backups already created (the orchestrator made them BEFORE the call; workflow-test does not create them).

**Execution range.** Stages run in the order Analyze → Plan → Write → Validation → Review → Done, starting at `start_stage` and continuing through `end_stage` inclusive. If `end_stage=null` — through the end of the profile. If `end_stage` is set but precedes `start_stage` in order, that is a contract error: return `{status: error, reason: "end_stage before start_stage"}`.

**Scope.** `stage_scope` controls execution width:
- `single` — only `start_stage` runs; afterwards the workflow returns `{status: ok, last_completed_stage: <start_stage>, next_recommended_action: stop}`. Used for `action=redo`.
- `forward` — `start_stage` plus every subsequent stage up to `end_stage` (or to the end of the profile). Used for `action=run`/`continue`/`restart`.
- `all` — equivalent to `forward` with `start_stage = first stage of the profile`. Used for `action=restart-full`.

## 2. Stages

A stage that names an agent is executed by that agent. Dispatch it per `conventions/stage-dispatch.md` — stage work does not run in the main context, and a stage that skips its agent says so before it starts.

- **Analyze** — a panel: `swift-toolkit:swift-architect` + `swift-toolkit:swift-tester` (via the Task tool, in parallel or sequentially as the orchestrator decides). Artifact: `Research.md`. Goal: determine **what to test** (uncovered code, critical paths, regression scenarios), **what test level** (unit / integration / UI / snapshot), **which frameworks** (XCTest / Quick+Nimble / ViewInspector / SnapshotTesting). Additionally, `swift-toolkit:swift-architect` evaluates the testability of existing code: whether dependency injection, mocks, or protocols for abstracting external dependencies are required.

- **Plan** — `swift-toolkit:swift-tester`. Artifact: `Plan.md` with **two layers of progress tracking**:
  1. **Top-level phase progress table** (see `State Detection` in orchestrator: statuses ✅/🔄/⬜/⏸/🚫/⊘) — one row per phase with a `P0`/`P1`/`P2` priority column, coarse-grained completion.
  2. **Per-phase detail section** for each phase — actionable items rendered as **markdown checkboxes** `- [ ] <item>`. Granularity: one checkbox per test case to add, per fixture/mock to create, per assertion-cluster to verify. Granular enough to be ticked individually as the Write stage progresses. Static prose (test-strategy notes, framework choices) stays as plain bullets — only **action items** become checkboxes.

  The plan decomposes tests into phases — usually by groups (one phase per testable component / module / use case). Each phase is assigned a priority `P0` (critical, blocks release) / `P1` (important) / `P2` (nice-to-have).

- **Write** — `swift-toolkit:swift-tester`. Implements the phases from `Plan.md` step by step, updating both progress layers as work proceeds. **MUST create one git commit per green phase** — autonomously, without a user prompt.

  Per-item flow inside a phase: complete one actionable item → tick its checkbox `- [ ]` → `- [x]` in the per-phase detail section of Plan.md. Per-phase flow: when all the phase's checkboxes are `- [x]` → build → run the newly added tests for that phase → flip the phase's row in the top-level progress table ⬜→✅ → `git add` the phase's files (including the Plan.md updates — both checkboxes and table) → `git commit`. Commit message format: **Conventional Commits** — `<type>(<scope>): <imperative subject>` followed by an optional body explaining WHY. For Write-stage commits the type is `test` (use `chore` for test-infrastructure-only phases — fixtures/helpers without test logic). **NEVER include the task ID, step ID, or phase number** — provenance lives in `Plan.md`, the branch name, and the PR description. Full spec + anti-examples in `conventions/commit-messages.md`. Example:

  ```
  test(PaginationCalculator): cover boundary and overflow inputs

  Locks in the expected page-range output for empty / single-page / max-page
  inputs — guards against regressions when the calculator is refactored.
  ```

  If `git log` shows the project uses a different convention for similar tasks, follow that convention instead.

  **A phase is not "done" (✅ in the top table) until ALL its granular checkboxes are `- [x]` AND the phase is committed.** Partial completion stays at 🔄 in the top table with the un-ticked checkboxes still `- [ ]`. Artifacts: test code in the project + test helpers/fixtures/mocks where needed + the resulting commit history. **Does NOT modify production code.** If the code under test turns out to be untestable without refactoring (tight coupling, singletons, missing protocols for mocking) — returns `{status: error, reason: refactor_required, notes: "<what specifically blocks, which component>"}` so the orchestrator/user can decide to create a separate REFACTOR task.

  **Comment hygiene (hard rule, enforced by `swift-tester`):** NEVER embed task/phase/EPIC references in test code comments or in XCTAssert/XCTFail/`XCTSkip` message strings (`// §1.6 Phase 7: identity-preservation invariant`, `XCTFail("not used in §1.5 tests")`, `// EPIC X / Phase Y — stub for …`). Assertion messages are read in test-failure output and must be self-explanatory without phase context. Provenance lives in the per-phase git commit message + the test name itself. See `agents/swift-developer.md → ## Comment Policy` — same rule applies to tests.

  If `start_phase=<phase_id>` was passed in args — `swift-toolkit:swift-tester` receives that phase as the start point in the Task-tool prompt. Already-completed phases (status `✅` in `Plan.md`) are skipped, not redone. The progress table is updated only for new / changed phases.

  When the stage's phases are done, apply `swift-toolkit:task-walkthrough` and write `Walkthrough.md` — the human-facing account of what actually landed, readable before anything has been validated or reviewed. Governed by `[WALKTHROUGH]` in `Task.md`, else `## Reporting` → `walkthrough` in `CLAUDE-swift-toolkit.md`, else `on`. Written by `swift-toolkit:swift-tester`.

- **Validation** — `swift-toolkit:swift-validator`. Artifact: `Validation.md`, **first line is required** to be `[VALIDATION_STATUS] = PASSED | FAILED | FLAKY` (the shared contract between `swift-validator`, every `workflow-*`, and the orchestrator; analogous to `[REVIEW_STATUS]`). For the TEST profile, the validator runs XcodeBuildMCP `test_sim` mandatorily (every newly added test must pass on first run / green); on a first-run failure the validator re-runs the failing test up to 3 times and, if results flap, returns `[VALIDATION_STATUS] = FLAKY` with the test name, fail rate, and a hypothesized cause recorded in `Validation.md`. mobile MCP is optional — only for UI tests requiring visual verification, and `mobile_mcp` resolving to `off` (`Task.md [MOBILE_MCP]` first, then `CLAUDE-swift-toolkit.md ## Validation`) removes even that option. Detailed behavior (flaky-detection procedure, return-digest format) lives in `agents/swift-validator.md`. Since no mobile-MCP step is mandatory on this profile, `off` here drops an optional check rather than handing one over, and `auto` therefore has nothing to defer and writes no `ManualChecks.md`. `manual_checks: always` (`Task.md [MANUAL_CHECKS]` first, then `CLAUDE-swift-toolkit.md ## Validation`) is what produces that artifact on a UI-bearing test run: the ground a green suite leaves unverified — push, biometrics, camera, permission dialogs, backgrounding, low connectivity — written up as cases a human walks, with the matching `OpsChecklist.md` items Pending and the case titles returned in `manual_checks`; surface that list with the stage report.

- **Review** — `swift-toolkit:swift-reviewer` (if `need_review=true` in args). **Special case for the TEST profile:** the review evaluates the quality of the **tests**, not production code — edge-case coverage, meaningful assertions (no "assert true == true"), absence of mocks for logic that should be tested directly, isolation of tests from each other, readability and maintainability. Artifact: `Review.md`, **first line is required** to be `[REVIEW_STATUS] = APPROVED | CHANGES_REQUESTED | DISCUSSION` (this field is the shared contract between workflow-* and the orchestrator; it is also used by `swift-toolkit:workflow-review` for auto-move into DONE/). On a redo after `CHANGES_REQUESTED`, the reviewer finds its own prior `Review.md` in the task folder and narrows scope to the commits landed since its `[REVIEWED_COMMIT]` line instead of re-reviewing the whole task from scratch — see `agents/swift-reviewer.md` → "1. Identify Scope".

- **Done** — final report `Done.md`: what is now covered (list of components and scenarios), what coverage was achieved (if measured), the list of frameworks used, validation status (are all added tests green, any flaky), and objections (if the user insisted on a contested decision — e.g. declining to test a critical path).

  Refresh `Walkthrough.md` here when the Write stage did not run in this invocation — an entry at Review or Done means commits landed after it was written. `task-walkthrough` owns the refresh rules; its `[COVERS]` line decides whether there is anything to do.

## 3. Manual mode

After each completed stage the orchestrator asks the user via the structured question mechanism using the `stage_done_prompt` key from `locales/<lang>.md`, with placeholder `{stage}`.

Workflow-test **does NOT ask the user itself** — it returns control to the orchestrator after a stage completes (see section 5, Output Contract) with `next_recommended_action`. The decision to pause, continue, or capture discussions in `Questions.md` is the orchestrator's responsibility.

If the active host has no structured question tool, the orchestrator uses a textual fallback (numbered options + reply parsing). That is the orchestrator's responsibility, not workflow-test's.

## 4. Auto mode

No pauses between stages. Workflow-test runs the stages sequentially within `stage_scope` and returns the final result to the orchestrator in a single output.

**Per-phase commits inside the Write stage are autonomous** — created without a user prompt, in both manual and auto modes. The only commit that always requires confirmation regardless of mode is a flow-level wrap commit (squash, merge, push) when the orchestrator initiates one. That confirmation is the orchestrator's responsibility, not workflow-test's.

## 5. Output Contract

After each stage (in `manual` mode) or after a full pass (in `auto` mode), workflow-test returns a JSON-like structure to the orchestrator:

```
{
  status: ok | error | cancelled | interrupted,
  last_completed_stage: Analyze | Plan | Write | Validation | Review | Done,
  artifact_path: <path to the final artifact, e.g. Tasks/ACTIVE/001-test/Done.md>,
  next_recommended_action: continue | stop | ask_user,
  notes: <free-form text, optional>
}
```

Field semantics:
- `status=ok` — the stage finished correctly.
- `status=error` — an error occurred (including reasons such as the locale key `status_error_empty_required_field`, an invalid contract, a fatal subagent failure, or `refactor_required` from the Write stage).
- `status=cancelled` — the user explicitly declined to continue (the orchestrator forwarded a `No` from its AUQ; rendered to the user via locale key `status_cancelled_user_no`). A normal outcome, not an error.
- `status=interrupted` — execution was interrupted by a technical fault or external signal (not by user decision): subagent disconnect, timeout, tool unavailable. Requires diagnostics on the orchestrator side.
- `last_completed_stage` — the last stage that actually finished (not the one execution stopped on with an error).
- `artifact_path` — path to the key artifact of the last stage (`Research.md`, `Plan.md`, `Validation.md`, `Review.md`, `Done.md`). The Write stage has no dedicated `.md` artifact — points to `Plan.md` (with the updated progress table).
- `next_recommended_action=continue` — the next stage may start immediately; `stop` — natural finish (Done) or a fatal error; `ask_user` — confirmation is needed before continuing (e.g. after a Validation with `[VALIDATION_STATUS] = FAILED | FLAKY`, after a Review with `[REVIEW_STATUS] = CHANGES_REQUESTED`, or after `refactor_required` from Write).
- `notes` — short free-form description (e.g. the examples in locale keys `notes_test_failed_example` and `notes_refactor_required_example`).

Based on this, the orchestrator decides: continue, abort, or ask the user.

## 6. What workflow-test does NOT do

- Does NOT route — profile selection happens in the orchestrator before the call.
- Does NOT read `Task.md` to determine stack/mode — everything arrives in `args`.
- Does NOT trigger `task-new` or `task-move` — that is not its scope.
- Does NOT decide to skip stages — the orchestrator already passed `start_stage`, `end_stage`, `stage_scope`.
- Does NOT create backups in `_archive/` — the orchestrator did so before handing off control; the paths are already in `archive_paths`.
- Does NOT ask the user — the orchestrator does that between stages in `manual` mode.
- Does NOT **ask** the user before per-phase commits — workflow-test creates them autonomously after each green phase, with no user prompt. The orchestrator handles user-facing commit confirmation only for any flow-level wrap commit it initiates (squash, merge, push). **"Does NOT confirm with user" means "does not interrupt to ask", NOT "does not commit".** Failing to commit per phase loses incremental progress on interrupt and forces a re-do of the whole Write stage.
- Does NOT modify production code. If the code under test is not testable without refactoring — returns `{status: error, reason: refactor_required}`; does not patch on its own.
- Does NOT decide on coverage metrics (coverage thresholds, target percentages) — that's the orchestrator's / user's domain; workflow-test only writes tests per the plan and records the actual coverage in `Done.md`.
