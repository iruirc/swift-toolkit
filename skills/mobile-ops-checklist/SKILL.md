# Mobile Ops Checklist

A cross-cutting checklist distilled from production mobile engineering challenges (Orosz, Building Mobile Apps at Scale). It is *not* a design tool — design happens in `feature-landscape`. It is the late-stage verification that nothing operational was forgotten: feature flag, analytics, deep link, push, offline, privacy, App Store readiness.

> **Related skills:**
> - `feature-requirements` — Secondary list maps onto a subset of this checklist; this skill is the validation-time counterpart
> - `feature-landscape` — graph layers determine which items apply (no networking layer → most networking items become N/A)
> - `error-architecture` — error-handling items reference its taxonomy
> - `persistence-migrations` — schema-migration items expand here
> - `concurrency-architecture` — background work / cancellation items
> - `net-architecture` — retry / pagination / cache items
> - `swift-toolkit:swift-security` — privacy / Keychain / pinning items

## When to use

- Validation stage of `workflow-feature` / `workflow-bug` / `workflow-refactor`
- Review stage — cross-check that items marked Applicable in this artifact were actually implemented
- Pre-release readiness review
- Direct invocation when the user asks "is this ready to ship?" / "did we cover everything?"

## How to use

For each item, choose one of:

- **Applicable** — write the verification evidence: file path, commit ref, test name, screenshot reference, or `Reproduce.md` step
- **N/A (reason)** — write a short reason: "no UI layer", "CLI tool", "internal-only feature", "feature flag not introduced"
- **Pending** — work not yet done; surfaces as a blocker for the Review stage

Default an item to **Applicable** unless you have a concrete reason to mark it N/A. Conservative bias is intentional — the cost of false-Applicable is a small extra check; the cost of false-N/A is a production incident.

## Inputs

- The active task's `Research.md` + `Plan.md`, plus the task's per-phase git commits as the record of what actually landed
- Project stack from `CLAUDE-swift-toolkit.md` — platform target, UI framework, etc.
- The product context (internal vs public-facing, B2B vs consumer)

## Checklist categories

### Release & rollout

- [ ] Feature flag wraps the new feature (kill switch ready)
- [ ] Gradual rollout plan documented (1% → 10% → 100% with monitoring gates)
- [ ] Minimum supported OS version covered
- [ ] App Store / Play Store review constraints reviewed (no rejection risk: no private API use, no IDFA misuse, no payment-flow violation)
- [ ] Forced-upgrade path considered if breaking

- [ ] Background → foreground refresh policy decided

### Networking

- [ ] API endpoints versioned or contract stable

- [ ] Tested with assistive tech, not just static audit

### Localization

- [ ] No hardcoded user-visible strings
- [ ] RTL layout (Arabic / Hebrew) verified if app ships those locales
- [ ] Pluralization rules use the platform's stringsdict / plural resources

- [ ] Beta distribution path verified
- [ ] Code-signing / provisioning profile updated if entitlements changed

## Output artifact

Write a **separate file** `OpsChecklist.md` in the task folder (`Tasks/<STATUS>/<NNN-slug>/OpsChecklist.md`). Do **not** inline into `Validation.md` — the checklist evolves through Validation → Review and survives as a standalone audit artifact in the eventual `Done.md` reference.

Structure:

```markdown
# Ops Checklist — <task-id>

> Generated by `mobile-ops-checklist`. Mark each item Applicable / N/A (reason) / Pending.

## Release & rollout
- [x] Feature flag wraps the feature — `Features.cartV2` in `FeatureFlags.swift:42`
- [x] Gradual rollout plan — `docs/cart-v2-rollout.md`
- [ ] Pending: minimum-OS check
- N/A: Forced-upgrade — internal beta only, no public release

## State & lifecycle
- [x] All four UI states covered — `CartView` previews `CartView_Previews.swift`
- [x] Single source of truth — `CartViewModel.state`
- N/A: Background sync — feature is online-only

## ...
```

**Idempotency:** if `OpsChecklist.md` already exists, prompt the user — overwrite / merge / skip. Re-checking a list mid-feature is normal; preserve prior entries with timestamps if merging.

## Platform-specific N/A semantics

- **SPM library** — Most categories N/A: deep links, push, App Store, accessibility (no UI), analytics (library should not emit), localization (consumer's job). Applicable: error handling, performance, testing, third-party SDKs, CI/CD, security (if handling secrets).
- **CLI tool** — Push / deep links / accessibility / localization N/A. Crash reporting may be N/A (stderr is the report). Privacy still applies if reading user files.
- **macOS app (Developer ID distribution)** — App Store review N/A; notarization still applies.
- **iOS app** — All categories typically Applicable.

## Anti-patterns to avoid

- **Marking everything Applicable to be safe.** Forces noise. Each Applicable needs a verification step — if you can't write evidence, downgrade to Pending.
- **Marking N/A without reason.** Future reviewer can't tell if N/A is correct or a cop-out. Always write the reason.
- **Filing OpsChecklist.md and moving on.** The checklist is a Review-stage input — the reviewer agent reads it and cross-checks Applicable items against the actual diff.
- **Seeding this checklist at Plan and carrying it through Execute.** Design-time coverage of the same concerns is `feature-requirements`' job — its Secondary enumeration reaches `Research.md ## Requirements` and becomes work items in `Plan.md`. This artifact is the verification-time counterpart, written once at Validation; spreading it across stages gives those concerns a second source of truth that drifts from the first.
- **Hiding pending items by deleting them.** Pending = blocker. Either resolve it, get explicit N/A approval, or push the release.

## What this skill does NOT do

- Does NOT design the feature — that's `feature-landscape`.
- Does NOT estimate effort of completing items — combine with `feature-estimation` if needed.
- Does NOT auto-fix Pending items — it surfaces them; humans / agents handle resolution.
- Does NOT replace `swift-toolkit:swift-security` — security audit is a deeper pass, this checklist's privacy/security section is the surface scan.
